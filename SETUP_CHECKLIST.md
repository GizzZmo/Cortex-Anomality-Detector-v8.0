cd Cortex-Anomality-Detector-v8.0
```

- [ ] Repository cloned successfully
- [ ] Changed to project directory

## Step 2: Download Face Recognition Models üì•

Face-api.js models are required for face detection. Download from:
https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

### Required Files:
- [ ] `ssd_mobilenetv1_model-weights_manifest.json`
- [ ] `ssd_mobilenetv1_model-shard1`
- [ ] `face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json`
- [ ] `face_landmark_68_model-shard1`
- [ ] `face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json`
- [ ] `face_recognition_model-shard1`

### Place files in:
```
frontend/public/models/
```

- [ ] All 6 model files downloaded
- [ ] Files placed in correct directory
- [ ] Verified files are in `frontend/public/models/`

## Step 3: Get API Key üîë

1. Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create new API key
4. Copy the key (you'll enter it in the app)

- [ ] API key obtained
- [ ] API key copied and saved securely

## Step 4: Build and Run üöÄ

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**First-time build may take 5-10 minutes.**

### Expected Output:
```
‚úì frontend container started
‚úì backend container started
‚úì ai_service container started
‚úì Database initialized
‚úì All services running
```

- [ ] Docker Compose started successfully
- [ ] No error messages in terminal
- [ ] All three services are running

### Verify Services:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Should show:
- frontend (port 80)
- backend (port 3001)
- ai_service (port 5001)

- [ ] All services show "Up" status

## Step 5: Access Application üåê

Open browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost
```

- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] No console errors (F12 to check)
- [ ] Interface displays correctly

## Step 6: Configure API Key üîß

In the application:
1. Find "API Configuration" section
2. Paste your Google AI Studio API Key
3. Click "Save API Key"
4. Verify "‚úì API Key configured" message appears

- [ ] API key entered
- [ ] API key saved
- [ ] Success message displayed

## Step 7: Test Features üß™

### Face Recognition
- [ ] Click "Start Detection"
- [ ] Camera permission granted
- [ ] Video feed appears
- [ ] Face detection boxes appear

### AI Protocols
- [ ] Enter a prompt
- [ ] Click "Generate"
- [ ] Response appears

### Chat Assistant
- [ ] Type a message
- [ ] Click "Send" or press Enter
- [ ] Chat response appears

### System Logs
- [ ] Logs section shows activity
- [ ] Real-time updates working

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Services Won't Start
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```
- [ ] Tried restart

### Port 80 In Use
Change frontend port in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:80"  # Use port 8080 instead
```
Then access: http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Port changed if needed

### Face Detection Not Working
- [ ] Verified all 6 model files are present
- [ ] Checked browser console for errors
- [ ] Camera permissions granted
- [ ] Tried different browser

### AI Not Responding
- [ ] API key is correct
- [ ] API key has been activated in Google AI Studio
- [ ] No quota/limit issues
- [ ] Backend service is running

### Database Errors
```bash
docker-compose down -v  # Remove volumes
docker-compose up --build
```
- [ ] Database reset if needed

## Development Mode (Optional) üíª

For local development without Docker:

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma db push
npm start
```
- [ ] Backend running on port 3001

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
- [ ] Frontend running on port 3000

### AI Service
```bash
cd ai_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
- [ ] AI Service running on port 5001

## Verification Checklist ‚úÖ

- [ ] All Docker services running
- [ ] Application accessible at http://localhost
- [ ] API key configured
- [ ] Face detection working
- [ ] AI generation working
- [ ] Chat assistant working
- [ ] System logs updating in real-time
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No terminal errors

## Next Steps üéØ
